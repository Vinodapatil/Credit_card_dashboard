Card Category Performance: Analysis of revenue and transaction volume for different card categories (e.g., Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
Gender-Based Analysis: Comparison of total revenue generated by male and female customers.
Weekly and Quarterly Trends: Visualization of transaction volumes and revenue over time (weekly and quarterly).
Income Group Analysis: Examining the revenue breakdown by customer income groups (High, Medium, Low).
The dashboard helps businesses understand customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and improve financial decision-making processes.

Technologies Used:
